Titanic Survival Prediction â€” Model Improvement Summary

Overview
This project focuses on predicting passenger survival on the Titanic using machine learning. The current work involves improving the baseline predictive model by applying hyperparameter tuning and feature engineering, primarily using Random Forest classifiers.

Key Activities Completed

1. Hyperparameter Tuning for Logistic Regression
- Applied GridSearchCV to optimize regularization strength and solver parameters.
- Achieved moderate improvements in cross-validation and test accuracy (~75%-77%).

2. Random Forest Model Implementation
- Built a baseline Random Forest classifier with default hyperparameters.
- Observed improved accuracy (~81%) and better class-wise recall and F1-score compared to logistic regression.

3. Random Forest Hyperparameter Tuning
- Performed GridSearchCV over parameters such as number of trees, maximum tree depth, minimum samples required to split nodes or be leaves, and number of features considered for splits.
- Identified best hyperparameters that balance model complexity and generalization.
- Obtained cross-validated accuracy of ~80.5% and test accuracy around 81.3%.

4. Feature Engineering
- Created new categorical features:
  - Age groups (Child, Teen, Adult, Middle_Aged, Senior) by binning the age variable.
  - Family size groups (Alone, Small, Large) by categorizing passenger family sizes.
- Converted new features and existing categorical variables into dummy variables.
- Incorporated these engineered features into preprocessing workflow with scaling and transformation.
- Retrained and evaluated the model with the enhanced dataset.

Next Steps
- Explore further feature engineering to capture additional domain insights.
- Experiment with advanced algorithms such as Gradient Boosting (XGBoost, LightGBM).
- Investigate ensemble methods combining multiple classifiers.
- Perform detailed evaluation with ROC-AUC and precision-recall analysis.
- Work on model interpretation techniques for explainability.

How to Run
- Install required Python packages: pandas, seaborn, scikit-learn.
- Execute preprocessing, model training, and tuning scripts in sequence.
- Review printed evaluation metrics including accuracy, confusion matrices, and classification reports.

Summary
The improved modeling approach demonstrates better predictive performance over the baseline by leveraging systematic tuning and thoughtful feature creation, providing a strong foundation for continued enhancements.
